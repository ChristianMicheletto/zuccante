Dear Mr Yung,
I'd like to restore my shakuhachi. First of all it is hard to separate the two half parts of the instrument, second there is a repaired krack in the upper half that is visible as an inner crak in bore, third my shakuhachi needs a blowing edge refurbishing, finally perhaps it is necessary to perform a retuning. 
I have any photos.
